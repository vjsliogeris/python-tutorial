# Python!

If you've not installed `git` and cloned the repo
from the text of the previous page - do that first.

Python is a programming language, easy to learn and to master idc.

## Setup

The setup for python should be similar to the setup for github.
On ubuntu, install it via the apt thingy in the terminal.

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

Or, on windows, you can install it via vscode.
Vscode is generally great with tooltips - if it suggests you install something,
generally it's a good idea.
Look at the extensions tab for "python", and install it.

Done? Great! Move on to `base/` for further tutorials.
If you're feeling like reading and studying,
just go over the text as you did now.
Otherwise, you can move straight to `bossfight/` to try and do the tasks,
and reverse engineer stuff from the text.
Whatever works.
