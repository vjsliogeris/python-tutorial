# Data structures/ functions/ for loops.

Don't forget to create a new branch off of main before working on stuff!

THE TASK(s):

## Task 1
I want `thing_1.py` to do the following thing:
I want it to keep asking for numbers.
When it gets an empty input - it calculates the average of the numbers.
```bash
<renamorcen@salomeike:~/education/python-tutorial/tutorial_python/data_structures/homework>
zsh/4 41 [1]  (git)-[feature/data_structures]-% python thing_1.py
Give me a number
1
5
2

Empty input received. Computing average.
2.6666666666666665
```

## Task 2
This will be in `thing_2.py`.
The program should ask for a number of people.
Then the user inputs names and numbers.
Lastly it returns the name with highest number.
Example operation:
```bash
<renamorcen@salomeike:~/education/python-tutorial/tutorial_python/data_structures/homework>
zsh/4 43  (git)-[feature/data_structures]-% python thing_2.py
